### PICK UP AND RUN ###
Plogging is a combination of jogging with picking up litter, merging the Swedish verbs plocka upp.
Plogging is a fitness and environmental activity that combines jogging (or running) with picking up litter or trash along the way.
The key to plogging is not just the concept of environmental protection of picking up trash, but approaching picking up trash as one of the health-training exercises.
<br>
## About Our WebApp ##
Our webapp focuses on the environmental issue of trash and litter that can be easily found on roads, parks, etc. So as a part of this planet, we can also contribute to its health and cleanliness.
As we can see jogging is done by every age group people so we can take this as a step towards both our health as well to environment.
While running if you see trash you can pick it up and throw it in a dustbin which helps in promoting a clean environment. 
<br> So, our webapp focuses on this and when you start running you can log into our App and start the stopwatch which will show your jogging time when you see trash you can click its photo and upload the model will detect it is trash and then you can pick up it and throw it in dustbin during this you can also pause your stopwatch.

### So lets contribute towards Environment and Health together for better future ###
